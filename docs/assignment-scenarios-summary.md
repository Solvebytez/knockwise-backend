## Status Update Logic Applied:

### For Individual Agents:
```typescript
// Check for ANY active assignments to ANY zones
const hasActiveAssignments = await AgentZoneAssignment.exists({
  agentId: agentId,
  status: { $nin: ['COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'] }
});
const hasPendingScheduled = await ScheduledAssignment.exists({
  agentId: agentId,
  status: 'PENDING'
});

if (!hasActiveAssignments && !hasPendingScheduled) {
  // Set to UNASSIGNED
} else {
  // Keep as ASSIGNED
}
```

### For Teams:
```typescript
// Check for ANY active assignments to ANY zones
const hasActiveAssignments = await AgentZoneAssignment.exists({
  teamId: teamId,
  status: { $nin: ['COMPLETED', 'CANCELLED'] }
});
const hasPendingScheduled = await ScheduledAssignment.exists({
  teamId: teamId,
  status: 'PENDING'
});

if (!hasActiveAssignments && !hasPendingScheduled) {
  // Set to UNASSIGNED
} else {
  // Keep as ASSIGNED
}
```

## Key Features:

1. **Full Flexibility**: Handles all possible assignment changes
2. **Status Accuracy**: Only sets UNASSIGNED if no assignments to ANY zones
3. **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removes old assignments before creating new ones
4. **Special Cases**: Handles team-to-individual where individual is from same team
5. **Timing Support**: Supports both immediate and scheduled assignments
6. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive console logs for debugging
7. **Force Checks**: Double-checks status after updates to ensure accuracy

## Assignment Status Rules:

- **ASSIGNED**: Agent/Team has at least one active assignment to any zone
- **UNASSIGNED**: Agent/Team has no active assignments to any zones
- **Status is checked across ALL zones**, not just the current zone being updated
- **Only COMPLETED and CANCELLED assignments are excluded** from status calculation
- **PENDING scheduled assignments count as active** for status purposes
